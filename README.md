Iron Scripter Challenge 05/26/2021

Project isn't finished yet. This is only the v3.

In order to play the game, you need to run the function  Start-Shut_The_Boxe 

Start-Shut_The_Boxe requires two arguments : 


      Start-Shut_The_Boxe 
      -number_of_players        Setup how many players are joining the game                     Accepted value : number between 2 and 6
      -table_size               Setup how many tiles are inside the boxe (default : 9)          Accepter value : number between 9 and 12




The ASCII dice generator is a tweak to another Redditor I can't find the name back. 
I ended up using this method as his ASCII was far better than mine and allows to print all of the dice on the "same line". 

Thanks to PeterJoAl from Reddit for his help to come accross a clean way to get all of the possible combinations. My first attempt was quite a mess.
